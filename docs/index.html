<h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
<p>We plan to simulate fluids in a 3D space. By changing the density of the fluid, we hope to see different physical dispersions of the liquid.</p>

<h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
<p>Fluid simulation is a special case of physical simulation. By extending the 2D lattice structure from project 4 to 3D, we can simulate interactions of particles in 3 dimensions.
</p>
<p>This is challenging because we are representing a fluid as an infinite number of particles. We would need to find the minimum number of particles needed for a realistic representation.  The constraints for each particle are non-linear and include components of the n neighbors of each particle. This makes it hard to solve the equations via linear methods and may cause instability in our solution if momentum is not conserved.
</p>
<p>3D fluid simulation is cool! Animation of fluids is common in video games and animated movies. We think it’s important for simulating natural disasters (tsunamis & floods)  and other places as water/fluids are omnipresent.
</p>
<p>We plan to implement this by modeling a fluid as a lot of particles. Then, we apply forces to each particle at every stage in a loop. As these particles move, they exert forces on each other, causing the movement of the entire fluid. We adjust the density of these particles to affect how quickly the fluid moves.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
<p>Our end goal with this project will be to successfully implement the Nvidia research paper on water simulation by Macklin and Muller, but to add a density control that would allow us to demonstrate different types of fluids, ranging from water vapor (gases) to lava (the most dense liquid we could think of).
We will aim to create GIFs of simulated fluids of different densities to demonstrate the differences in simulation due to the fluid density.
</p>

<h5>Stretch Goals</h5>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Interactive Slider bar to change the density of the fluid while it is being simulated </li>
    <li>Use path tracing to render the fluid surface using ellipsoid splatting (as done in the Nvidia paper). </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>We will measure the quality of the simulation by comparing it to the baselines in videos of moving fluids and to output images in the Nvidia research paper. </p>

<p>In our analysis, we plan to answer the following questions:<p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>How can the particle model of physical simulation be applied to simulating 3D surfaces ie. fluids?</li>
    <li>How can we efficiently search for neighboring particles to display realistic particle motion in real-time?</li>
    <li>How can we efficiently render a fluid surface using path tracing or ellipsoid splatting? (stretch)</li>
  </ul>
</p>
